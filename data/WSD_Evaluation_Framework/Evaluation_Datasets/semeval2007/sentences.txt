Your Oct 6 editorial The Ill Homeless referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that was reported in the Sept 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association
Your comments implied we had discovered that the principal cause of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substanceabusing people in the homeless population
We have made no such statement
It is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless
The causes of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case
In quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism
You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse
They suffered from malnutrition chest diseases cardiovascular disorders skin problems infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape
Homeless people not only lack safety privacy and shelter they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition cleanliness and basic health care
In a recent report the Institute of Medicine pointed_out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness others may be a consequence of it and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter
The interactions between health and homelessness are complex defying sweeping generalizations as to cause or effect
If we look_to the future preventing homelessness is an important objective
This will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research

A study by Tulane Prof James Wright says homelessness is due to a complex array of problems with the common thread of poverty
The study shows that nearly 40 of the homeless population is made_up of women and children and that only 25 of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug alcohol and mental problems
According to Dr Wright homelessness is simultaneously a housing problem an employment problem a demographic problem a problem of social disaffiliation a mental health problem a family violence problem a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level

To quote the highly regarded director of a privately funded dropin center for the homeless in New York If you re homeless you do nt sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered
After your first three weeks of sleep deprivation you re scarcely in touch with reality any more without psychiatric treatment you may well be unable to fend for yourself ever again
Some of the homeless obviously had preexisting mental illness or addiction
But many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim brutal world of our city streets
Once there what ways of escape are open to them other than drink drugs or insanity
Maxwell RD Vos Brooklyn NY
You dismiss as sentimental the view that the reduction of federal housingassistance programs by 77 might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the ReaganBush years
There is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic namely that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness
Your research stopped when a convenient assertion could be made
Robert S Jenkins Cambridge Mass
Of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in Washington for the homeless you chose to cite such groups as the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen insinuating that the march got its major support from selfserving groups that know a good thing when they see it and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive
But is nt the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to and advertise in your paper
Why did nt you mention the YMCA or the YWCA or Catholic Charities USA or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that participated in the march
As for the findings on the 203 Baltimore homeless who underwent psychiatric examinations I suggest you conduct your own survey
Choose 203 business executives including perhaps someone from your own staff and put them out on the streets to be deprived for one month of their homes families and income
I would predict that within a short time most of them would find Thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for Chivas Regal and that their normal phobias anxieties depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically

Feeding Frenzy Henry Holt 326 pages 1995 a highly detailed account of the Wedtech scandal begins on a reassuring note
Right up front in the preface coauthor William Sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity
When offered a free trip from the Bronx Wedtech s home to Washington DC by one of Wedtech s principals he tells the reader mindful of accepting anything of value from those I was writing_about I declined
Any question as to why an author would believe this plaintive highminded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers
Bribe by bribe Mr Sternberg and his coauthor Matthew C Harrison Jr lead us along the path Wedtech traveled from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of fullfledged defense contractor entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy
The book revolves_around John Mariotta the founder of the company and Fred Neuberger who became his partner soon after Wedtech s creation
Although started in 1965 Wedtech did nt really get rolling until 1975 when Mr Neuberger discovered the federal government s Section 8 A minority business program
This is a Johnsonera Great Society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses
Mr Neuberger realized that although of Italian ancestry Mr Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico
The two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation
Instead of 5050 it became on paper only twothirds Mariotta onethird Neuberger and they were in the program and off to the races
Besides being a minorityowned company Wedtech was located in the South Bronx a blighted area made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign
The company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept using the minority South Bronx angle through the Reagan 80s
Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi now serving a jail sentence the company began a career of bribing federal state and local public officials and those close to public officials right up to and including E Robert Wallach close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese
Wedtech did nt just use old fashioned bribery
It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling retaining politically connected respectable law firms investment bankers and political consultants including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger
When necessary it sought and received assistance from organized crime
Sometimes the bribed became partners in the company
Wedtech management used the merit system
If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag but equity
If you were not an effective crook you found yourself out in the cold a fate that eventually befell Mr Mariotta the firm s semiliterate minority person
But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy easytoread tabloid writing style Feeding Frenzy often falls_short of gripping reading
None of the scams show much ingenuity Auditors found crookery the first day on the job
Wedtech s scammers simply bribed them to shut_up
The scammers themselves were gardenvariety low lifes conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses Mercedes cars beautiful women expensive clothes
Among the lot of them not one is wrestling with good and evil or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane
The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack
He enters the story toward the end just in time to get arrested
Absorbed in doling out Feeding Frenzy s tidbits the authors gloss_over the root causes of Wedtech namely the Section 8 A federal program under whose auspices the scandal took_place
They do at least come_around to saying that the courts might want to end rigid affirmative action programs
Programs like Section 8 A are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up
Numerous other scandals among them the ones at HUD have the same characteristics as Wedtech
They take_place in government programs that seem tailormade for corruption
Why are programs like this not eliminated
Feeding Frenzy does provide a few clues
In and around all levels of government in the US are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party
They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment there is big money to be made in influencing brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government
They are our version of the East bloc s Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change
How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders
This is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal
Mr Stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corp 198385
I had to reach back to French 101 when the monsieur avec clipboard leaned over my shoulder during the coffee phase of dinner and asked whether I wanted to ride in a montgolfiere
I was a lastminute read interloping attendee at a French journalism convention and so far the festivities had been taken_up entirely by eating drinking smoking sleeping and drinking
The man with the clipboard represented a halfhearted attempt to introduce a bit of les sportif into our itinerary
But as the French embody a Zenlike state of blase when it comes_to athletics try finding a Nautilus machine in Paris my fellow conventioners were having none of it
The diners at my table simply lit more Gauloises and scoffed at the suggestion of interrupting a perfectly good Saturday morning to go golfing or even montgolfing ballooning to you the brothers Montgolfier French of course were the world s first hotair balloonists
Back in the USA this kind of chichi airborne activity wins heartwarmingly covetous responses
As in You went ballooning
In France
Americans it seems have followed Malcolm Forbes s hotair lead and taken_to ballooning in a heady way
During the past 25 years the number of balloonists those who have passed a Federal Aviation Authority lighterthanair test have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand with some estimates running as high as 10000
Some 30 balloon shows are held annually in the US including the world s largest convocation of ersatz Phineas Foggs the nineday Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta that attracts some 800000 enthusiasts and more than 500 balloons some of which are fetchingly shaped to resemble Carmen Miranda Garfield or a 12storyhigh condom
The condom balloon was denied official entry status this year
But in Epinal a gray 16thcentury river town adjacent to France s Vosges mountain region none of these Yankeecomelately enthusiasms for things aloft was evident
Ballooning at the de rigueur hour of 6 am held all the attraction for most people of sunrise rootcanal work
Feeling the naggings of a culture imperative I promptly signed_up
The first thing anybody will tell you about ballooning is that it requires zip in the way of athletic prowess or even a measure of derringdo
So long as you do nt look down
They will also tell you that even if you hate heights you can still balloon
I still say do nt look down
At least not when you are ascending
What they wo nt tell you is not to go aloft in anything you do nt want to get wet
I m not referring to the traditional champagne drenching during the backonterrafirma toast
I m talking about landing in a canal
In a porous wicker basket
With a pilot who speaks no English
To wit my maiden voyage and novitiates are referred to as virgins began at dawn on a dewsodden fairway and ended at noon in a soggy field
Balloon flights almost always occur at dawn or dusk when the winds are lightest
In between came lots of coffee drinking while watching the balloons inflate and lots of standing around deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order the baskets hold no more than four passengers
When it was nt my turn in the balloon I followed its progress from the chase car listening to the driver holler into a walkietalkie
After long stretches of this attendant ground activity came 20 or so lovely minutes of drifting above the Vosges watching the silver mists rise off the river and the French cows amble about the fields
It s hard not to feel that God s in his heaven with this kind of birdseye view of the world even if your pilote in silly plaid beret kept pointing_out how belle it all was
Eventually little French farmers and their little French farmwives came out of their stone houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and squinted at us
No wonder
We were coming down straight into their canal
See the other rule of thumb about ballooning is that you ca nt steer
And neither can your pilot
You can go only up or down by heating the balloon s air with a propane burner which does make the top of your head feel hot and ride the air currents
Which makes the chase car necessary
Most balloonists seldom go higher than 2000 feet and most average a leisurely 510 miles an hour
When the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion
Only when one is ascending or in our case descending a tad trop rapidement does one feel well airborne in a picnic basket
What s he doing hissed my companion who was the only other Englishspeaking member of the convention and whose knuckles were white
Attention yelled our pilot as our basket plunged into the canal
You bet attention I yelled back leaping atop the propane tanks I m wearing alligator loafers
Our pilot simply laughed fired up the burner and with another blast of flame lifted us oh a good 12inches above the water level
We scuttled along for a few feet before he plunged us into the drink again
Eventually we came to rest in a soggy patch of field where we had the exquisite pleasure of scrambling out of the basket into the mud while the French half of our ballooning tag team scrambled in
I looked at my watch
Barely halfanhour aloft
Back in the chase car we drove around some more got stuck_in a ditch enlisted the aid of a local farmer to get_out the trailer hitch and pull us out of the ditch
We finally rendezvoused with our balloon which had come to rest on a dirt road amid a clutch of Epinalers who watched us disassemble our craft another halfanhour of nonflight activity that included the precision routine of yanking the balloon to the ground punching all the air out of it rolling it up and cramming it and the basket into the trailer
It was the most exercise we d had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the nearest watering hole
This meant returning to the golf course where we watched a few French duffers maul the first tee while we sat under Cinzano umbrellas me nursing an espresso and my ego
A whole morning of ballooning and I had been off the ground barely 30 minutes
Still I figured the event s envyquotient back in the USA was near peerless
As for the ride back to camp our pilot and all the other Frenchspeaking passengers clambered into the chase car
My American companion and I were left to ride alfresco in the wicker basket
As we streaked by a blase gendarme I could nt resist rearing up on my soggy loafers and saluting
