The art of change_ringing is peculiar to the English and like most English peculiarities unintelligible to the rest of the world
Dorothy L Sayers The Nine Tailors
ASLACTON England __
Of all scenes that evoke rural England this is one of the loveliest An ancient stone church stands amid the fields the sound of bells cascading from its tower calling the faithful to evensong
The parishioners of St Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door as members here always have
In the tower five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614
But there is also a discordant modern note in Aslacton though it can not be heard by the church_goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening
Like most of the other 6000 churches in Britain with sets of bells St Michael once had its own band of ringers who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service
Now only one local ringer remains 64_year_old Derek Hammond
The others here today live elsewhere
They belong_to a group of 15 ringers __ including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training __ who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes_exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia
To ring for even one service at this tower we have to scrape says Mr Hammond a retired water_authority worker
We ve tried to train the youngsters but they have their discos and their dances and they just drift away
Mr Hammond worries that old_age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing
History after all is not on his side
According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago nearly a third of England s church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them
It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes
The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells as do the carillons of continental Europe is considered by the English to be childish fit only for foreigners
Change_ringing a mind_boggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago requires physical dexterity __ some bells weigh more than a ton __ combined with intense mental concentration
Proper English bells are started off in rounds from the highest_pitched bell to the lowest __ a simple descending scale using in larger churches as many as 12 bells
Then at a signal the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking
Each variation or change can occur only once the rules state
Ringers memorize patterns of changes known as methods which have odd_sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters
A series of 5000 or so changes is a peal and takes about three hours
A look at a Thursday night practice at St Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved
Ten shirt_sleeved ringers stand in a circle one foot ahead of the other in a prize_fighter s stance each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber
No one speaks and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves muffled by the ceiling
Totally absorbed the ringers stare straight ahead using peripheral_vision they call it rope_sight to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls
Far above in the belfry the huge bronze bells mounted on wheels swing madly through a full 360 degrees starting and ending surprisingly in the inverted or mouth_up position
Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change
In a well_known detective_story involving church bells English novelist Dorothy L Sayers described ringing as a passion that finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection
Ringers she added are filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed
Ringing does become a bit of an obsession admits Stephanie Pattenden master of the band at St Mary Abbot and one of England s best female ringers
It is a passion that usually stays in the tower however
More often than not ringers think_of the church as something stuck_on the bottom of the belfry
When their changes are completed and after they have worked_up a sweat ringers often skip off to the local pub leaving worship for others below
This does not sit well with some clerics
With membership of the Church_of_England steadily dwindling strong_willed vicars are pressing equally strong_willed and often non_religious ringers to attend services
Two years ago the Rev Jeremy Hummerstone vicar of Great Torrington Devon got so fed up with ringers who did nt attend service he sacked the entire band the ringers promptly set_up a picket_line in protest
They were a self_perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises the Vicar Hummerstone says
An entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington several of whom are members of the congregation
But there still are not enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells
At St Mary s Church in Ilminster Somerset the bells have fallen silent following a dust_up over church attendance
The vicar WD Jones refuses to talk_about it saying it would reopen the wound
But CJB Marshall vicar of a nearby church feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell_tower that are located next to the altar
So crunch crunch crunch bang bang bang __ here come the ringers from above making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer he says
Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue since he is both a vicar and an active bell_ringer himself
The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church he says
I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life
The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers a sort of parliament of ringing groups aims to improve relations with vicars says John C Baldwin president
It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell_ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled The Bells in Your Care
Says Mr. Baldwin We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience
Mr. Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem lack of ringers
One survey says that of the 100000 trained bellringers in England today only 40000 of them still ring
Also ringers do not always live where the bells need to be rung __ like in small rural parishes and inner_city churches
But the council s program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful says Mr. Baldwin
Right now we re lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10 he adds
One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male_dominated field more than a third of the ringers today are women
They are not accepted everywhere however
The oldest bell_ringing group in the country the Ancient Society of College Youths founded in 1637 remains male_only a fact thats particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain s most prestigious churches St Paul s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey
This being Britain no woman has filed an equal_opportunity suit but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to The Ringing World a weekly newspaper for ringers
One writer signing his letter as Red_blooded balanced male remarked on the frequency of women fainting in peals and suggested that they settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings
In the torrent of replies that followed one woman ringer from Solihull observed that the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired badly dressed decorated with acne and a large beer_belly frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals
Another women wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry
I have seen one or two men die bless them
Medical scientists are starting to uncover a handful of genes which if damaged unleash the chaotic growth of cells that characterizes cancer
Scientists say the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops
An emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention
That is for the future
Already scientists are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that for the first time can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to get cancer
Its a super_exciting set of discoveries says Bert Vogelstein a Johns Hopkins University researcher who has just found a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon cancer
Only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level
Today we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and then propel it into a deadly state
Scientists call the new class of genes tumor_suppressors or simply anti_cancer genes
When functioning normally they make proteins that hold a cell s growth in check
But if the genes are damaged __ perhaps by radiation a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division __ their growth_suppressing proteins no longer work and cells normally under control turn malignant
The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes
Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells suggesting that oncogenes do nt cause cancer by themselves
In recent months researchers have come to believe the two types of cancer genes work in_concert An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor_suppressor gene has been damaged
Like all genes tumor_suppressor genes are inherited in two copies one from each parent
Either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth so for cancer to arise both copies must be impaired
A person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor_gene or in whom one copy is damaged early in life is especially prone to cancer because he need only lose the other copy for a cancer to develop
Emerging genetic tests will be able to spot such cancer_susceptible individuals ushering_in what some scientists believe is a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis
Bill and Bonnie Quinlan are among the first beneficiaries of the new findings
The Dedham Mass couple knew even before Bonnie became pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs had a 50 chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma an eye cancer that occurs about once every 20000 births
Mr Quinlan 30 years old knew he carried a damaged gene having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old __ after his mother had suffered the same fate when she was a baby
Because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor_suppressor gene it became possible last January to find_out what threat the Quinlan baby faced
A test using new genetic probes showed that little Will Quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor_gene and therefore faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer
It made our New_Year says Mr Quinlan
This test was the first to predict reliably whether an individual could expect to develop cancer
Equally important the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth made by a Boston doctor named Thaddeus Dryja has opened a field of cancer study which in recent months has exploded
It turns_out that studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer says Samuel Broder director of the National Cancer Institute
All this may not be obvious to the public which is concerned about advances in treatment but I am convinced this basic research will begin showing results there soon
To_date scientists have fingered two of these cancer_suppressors
Dr Dryja made his retinoblastoma discovery in 1986
Then last spring researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which if impaired turns healthy colon cells cancerous
Soon after that report two other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers
Colon lung and breast cancers are the most common and lethal forms of the disease collectively killing almost 200000 Americans a year
Right now about a dozen laboratories in the U.S. Canada and Britain are racing to unmask other suspected tumor_suppressing genes
They have about seven candidates
Researchers say the inactivation of tumor_suppressor genes alone or in combination appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain the skin kidney prostate and cervix
There is evidence that if people inherit defective versions of these genes they are especially prone to cancer perhaps explaining finally why some cancers seem to haunt certain families
The story of tumor_suppressor genes goes_back to the 1970s when a pediatrician named Alfred G Knudson Jr proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects
He theorized that in the eye cancer an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other
The tumor he suggested developed when the second normal copy also was damaged
But there was no way to prove Dr Knudson s two_hit theory
Back then scientists had no way of ferreting_out specific genes but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes
Occasionally gross chromosome damage was visible
Dr Knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had had the disease
Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing
He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting_off the cancer
But he did not know which gene or genes had disappeared
Then a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee then at the University of Utah found the answer
The team used a battery of the newly developed gene probes snippets of genetic material that can track a gene s presence in a cell
By analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors they found defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome
The finding riveted medicine
It was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer
It was extraordinarily satisfying says Dr Knudson now at Fox Chase Cancer Research Center in Philadelphia
I was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers
It was an audacious claim
But in Baltimore Dr Vogelstein a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School believed Dr Knudson was right and set_out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers
His was one of two research teams in 1984 to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm s tumor
Dr Vogelstein next turned his attention colon cancer the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer
He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple hits on cancer suppressor_genes because it often seems to develop in stages
It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages __ progressing from less severe to deadly __ as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring
Dr Vogelstein and a doctoral student Eric Fearon began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage
They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions some existing only in benign polyps others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells
Gradually a coherent picture of cancer development emerged
If both copies of a certain gene were knocked_out benign polyps would develop
If both copies of a second gene were then deleted the polyps would progress to malignancy
It was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop
Their report galvanized other molecular biologists
It was the confirming evidence we all needed that gene losses were critical to the development of a common tumor says Ray White at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City
But Dr Vogelstein had yet to nail the identity of the gene that if damaged flipped a colon cell into full_blown malignancy
They focused_on chromosome 17
For months the Johns Hopkins researchers using gene probes experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17 looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells
Such a piece of DNA would probably constitute a gene
When they found it last winter Dr Vogelstein was dubious that the search was over
His doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher Arnold Levine had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones
The deletion Dr Vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53
But Mr Levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth whereas the Johns Hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth
Despite that when the Johns Hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the Mr Levine s p53 gene they found the two were identical it turned_out that in Mr Levine s cancer studies he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 __ a cancer_suppressing gene
The discovery suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation says Robert Weinberg a leader in cancer_gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge Mass
Evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor_gene is involved in other cancers too
Researchers in Edinburgh Scotland have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies
The scientists say that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families the gene when inherited in a damaged form may predispose women to the cancer
The p53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer
In a report out last week John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene
There also are reports from several labs as yet unpublished of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney brain and skin cancers
At_the_same_time the Johns Hopkins team and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor_suppressor genes
Dr Vogelstein hopes soon to isolate one on chromosome 18 also involved in colon cancer
Ray White in Utah and Walter Bodmer a researcher in Great Britain are close to finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer thought to be on chromosome 5
Dr Minna believes people who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer
Recently he and others reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor_gene may also be involved in some lung cancers as well as several other more common cancers too
Where these discoveries will lead scientists can only speculate
Already two major pharmaceutical companies the Squibb unit of Bristol_Myers Squibb Co and Hoffmann_La Roche Inc are collaborating with gene hunters to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and maybe new therapies
Some researchers say new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the suppressor proteins normally produced by the genes
The idea would be to administer to patients the growth_controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes
It may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions though no one has come_close to doing that so far
In_any_case says Dr Minna of the National Cancer Institute We re witnessing the discovery of one of the most important steps in the genesis of cancer
Why ca not we teach our children to read write and reckon
Its not that we do not know how to because we do
Its that we do not want to
And the reason we do not want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in_particular well as to violate some cherished vested interests
These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment our media our politicians and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them
Here is an example
If I were to ask a sample of American parents Do you wish the elementary_schools to encourage creativity in your children the near_unanimous answer would be Yes of_course
But what do we mean specifically by creativity
No one can say
In_practice it ends_up being equated with a self_expression that encourages the youngsters self_esteem
The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by their good opinion of themselves
The whole notion of creativity in education was and is part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction which was and is regarded_as authoritarian a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful if as yet undefined potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children
It is not surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance so attractive
Fortunately these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood and they have enough common_sense to know what that demands
Their commitment to creativity can not survive adolescent illiteracy
American education s future will be determined by the degree to which we __ all of us __ allow this common_sense to prevail over the illusions that we also share
The education establishment will fight against common_sense every_inch of the way
The reasons are complex but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated
Progressive education as it was once called is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction
It is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in personality development and even nicer to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results
It also provides teachers with a superior self_definition as a profession since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy
I myself took such courses in college thinking I might end_up a schoolteacher
They could all fairly be described as pap courses
But it is unfair to dump on teachers as distinct from the educational establishment
I know many schoolteachers and on_the_whole they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching
They may not be among the best and brightest of their generation __ there are very few such people by definition
But they need not be to do their jobs well
Yes we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days
But our education proceeded at the hands of those others who were merely competent and conscientious
In this sense a teacher can be compared to one s family_doctor
If he were brilliant he probably would not be a family_doctor in_the_first_place
If he is competent and conscientious he serves us well
Our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis
Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity it is not an educational problem
It is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more
It is the kind of libel the teachers unions do not mind spreading for their own narrow purposes
It is also the kind of libel politicians find useful since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency
But there is not one shred of evidence that other things being equal salary differentials result in educational differentials
If there were such evidence you can be sure you would have heard of it
If we wish to be serious about American education we know exactly what to do __ and just as important what not to do
There are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation some of them in the poorest of ghettos and they are all sending us the same message
Conversely there are the majority of unsuccessful schools and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand
We really do know all we need to know if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking
In this respect it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute rather than eloquently concerned
They are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap since this is the least controversial option that is open to them
Thus at the recent governors conference on education Gov Bill Clinton of Arkansas announced that this country needs a comprehensive child_development policy for children under five
A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need
What Gov Clinton is advocating in_effect is extending the educational system down to the pre_kindergarten years
Whether desirable or not this is a child_care program not an educational program
We know that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade but afterward the difference is quickly washed away
Let us sum_up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do not work __ Parental involvement is a bad idea
Parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children
Parents should be involved with their children s education at home not in school
They should see to it that their kids do not play truant they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing homework they should scrutinize the report_card
If parents are dissatisfied with a school they should have the option of switching to another
__ Community involvement is an even worse idea
Here the experience of New York City is decisive
Locally elected school_boards especially in our larger cities become the prey of ambitious generally corrupt and invariably demagogic local politicians or would_be politicians
New York is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20_year_old commitment to this system of school governance even as Chicago and other cities are moving to institute it
__ In most states increasing expenditures on education in our current circumstances will probably make things worse not better
The reason is simple Education takes_place in the classroom where the influence of money is minimal
Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils __ though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons
The new money flows into the already top_heavy administrative structure which busies itself piling more and more paper_work on the teachers
There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures in real terms have increased sharply in the past quarter_of_a_century __ we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world __ educational performance has declined
That is the way the system works
__ Students should move up the educational ladder as their academic potential allows
No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary_school without having mastered the 3 Rs at the level that prevailed 20 years ago
This means tracking whose main purpose is less to permit the gifted youngsters to flourish though that is clearly desirable than to ensure that the less gifted get the necessary grounding for further study or for entering the modern world of work
The notion that tracking is somehow undemocratic is absurd
The purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential
No one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential
__ It is generally desirable to use older textbooks __ many of them alas out of print __ rather than newer ones
The latter are modish trendy often downright silly and at best insubstantial
They are based on dubious psychological and sociological theories rather than on educational experience
One of the reasons American students do so poorly in math tests as compared with British French German or Japanese students is the influence of the New Math on American textbooks and teaching methods
Anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is __ with students who ca not add or subtract learning the conceptual basis of mathematical theory __ should read the article by Caleb Nelson himself a recent math major at Harvard in the November American Spectator
__ Most important of all schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty the curriculum and all matters of student discipline
Study after study __ the most recent from the Brookings Institution __ tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head
With that authority of_course goes an unambiguous accountability
Schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance
This is a fact __ though in view of all the feathers that are ruffled by this fact it is not surprising that one hears so little about it
