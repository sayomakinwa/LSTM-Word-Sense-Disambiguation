UN group drafts plan to reduce emissions
The UNsponsored climate conference characterized so far by unruly posturing and mutual recriminations gained renewed focus Friday with the release of a document outlining ambitious greenhousegas reductions over the next 40 years with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden in the near term
The text which could provide the basis for a final political deal to regulate greenhouse_gases highlighted the remaining obstacles as much as it illuminated a path forward
But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiation that is running out of time with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week
Forged by a UN adhoc working_group the text is silent on how much money rich countries would give poor ones to cope with global_warming over the short and long term
And it provides a range of options for the key questions including how developed and major emerging economies would cut their carbon output and what would be the upper_limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to tolerate
It gives a lot of flexibility to the process said John Coequyt senior Washington representative for the Sierra Club
Michael Zammit Cutajar who drafted the sixpage document boiled down a 180page negotiation text to focus on what the UN s top climate official Yvo de Boer described as the big picture
It shows the outlines for a possible deal in which industrial nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels while major developing_countries would reduce theirs during the same period by 15 to 30 percent
Together the countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050
The European_Union gave the talks a boost as well on Friday by pledging to provide 36 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate_change from coping with flood and drought to avoiding deforestation
Still Friday featured the same sort of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks for the past week
U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected language requiring binding cuts of greenhousegas emissions for industrialized countries compared with voluntary ones by major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world
The move signaled that the Obama administration is taking a harder_line with China than Bush_administration officials did just two years ago
The United_States is not going to do a deal without the major developing_countries stepping up and taking action said Stern who also complained that the text did not do enough to make sure the cuts could be verified by outside observers
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese vice foreign_minister He Yafei said America s top climate negotiator was either lacking common_sense or being extremely irresponsible for saying earlier in the week that the United_States would not help China financially to cope with global_warming
With the future economic trajectory of the world s major_powers at stake fault_lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies
The current battle is as much about saving individual economies as saving the planet with China and United_States feuding over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the world s two_dozen most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take bolder action
Ricardo Ulate a Costa Rican delegate said it s not surprising that the major_powers are fighting over who should bear the costs for curbing greenhouse_gases even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold the big emitters accountable for their actions
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed said Ulate who also serves as the regional Mexico and Central_America climate_change adviser for Conservation International
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate_change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen although most of the major participants say the talks will produce a political deal at best
The Alliance of Small Island States which has 43 members produced a 24page draft treaty proposal early Friday morning
Artur RungeMetzger who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission said the push by small island nations has put political pressure on the entire political process in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India
The talks took on new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government arrive to strike a deal
Highlevel officials such as Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vice minister stepped off planes and raced through the Bella Center s halls to closeddoor meetings and news_conferences so they could stake out claims that will be arbitrated over the next week
The sheer sprawl of the gathering where 13000 people move in and out of the convention center each day guitarplaying activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling out and draft proposals are passed handtohand on paper rather than via e_mail poses a challenge
The intensity is only building nearly all of the key ministers are now here and as early as Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen
We re getting into the big_leagues said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez vice_president for global policy at Conservation International
The heavyweights are coming
Baskonia gives away a victory in Israel
Caja Laboral achieved a stunning 8291 victory on their visit to the Maccabee Electra court despite Dusko Ivanovic s team s heavy losses and after the great performance by Mizra Teltovic who was the best on his team with eight threepointers scored 29 points they now at the top of their group
The Vitorian team knew to make up for the significant absences of Herrmann Oleson Huertas and Micov with a big dose of involvement and teamwork even though it had to hold out until the end to take the victory
Additionally their huge success from the sidelines with 16 three pointers scored had a lot to do with the final triumph
The game started out in favor of the Azulgranas who put themselves ahead on the scoreboard from the start
As Vitora s first four baskets were from the perimeter the speculation was already that they had jumped into the Israeli net with hot wrists
English and Teletovic were the main scorers of the 1820 at the end of the first_period
The second quarter was more of the same but the Alavan team opted for the inside game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu who was greeted with whistles and applause at his return home to continue increasing their lead by halftime 3443
Teletovic had already begun to stand out as the best on his team with 13 points even though Splitter s six fewer points already signaled that it was nt going to be the best night for the Brazilian
But the game despite being headed for halftime was not more decidedand the Maccabees tried to remind the Vitorians that not just anybody wins on their court and with the hand of Elias putting the pressure on they managed to get involved in the game
Eidson and Pnini played a decisive role in the yellows return to the light
More disadvantages
Ivanovic s players injured but far from dead needed to run a couple of plays correctly before they could breathe and that s when the machine gun Marza Teletovic arrived with three almost consecutive threepointers and the help of English and Ribas he brought the scoreboard back to a reassuring lead 5467 which the home team managed to narrow down at the end of the third quarter 5767
The Alavas worked themselves to the bone in the last period and English and San Emeterio 6575 had already made it clear that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had earned during the first thirty minutes
However Pnini and Eidson the best on their team did not give up and tried to keep their team alive from the threepoint line 7077
In spite of this and with Splitter fouling out Ivonic s team did nt rush defended well and even though the Israelis came close at the last_minute the game was already won and victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season
Wall_Street closes without momentum slowed by a strengthening dollar
The New_York_Stock_Exchange closed with no particular heading on Friday in a market torn between better than expected indicators in the United_States and a strengthening dollar the Dow_Jones gained 063 but the NASDAQ dropped 003
According to final closing figures the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 6567 points to 10 47150 points whereas the NASDAQ with a technology predominance fell by 055 point to 2 19031 points
The wider Standard amp Poor s 500 has itself advanced by 037 406 points to 1 10641 points
Frankly the market is very calm observes Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management
It remains within a narrow_margin trading volumes have become very weak and I think that this will remain the case until the end of the year
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators which have contributed to improving market opinion in relation to the robustness of the economic recovery summarised Charles Schwab s analysts
In the United_States retail sales have increased by 13 in November for the second month in a row and far more than predicted
Moreover the confidence of American consumers has clearly bounced back in December to 734 against 674 the previous month according to preliminary estimates from Michigan University s index
The indices have however been slowed by a renewed rise of the dollar to a new twomonth high against the Euro which puts downward pressure on the sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation explained Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank
Technology securities have thereby lost some ground
The bond market has fallen
Treasury 10year bond yields have grown to 3540 against 3482 on Tuesday evening and 30year bond yields are at 4497 against 4492 the previous evening
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches deals with 10 foreign oil_companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil_companies to rebuild its ailing infrastructure during two auctions that concluded Saturday
The 10 deals the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil_companies suggest that China Russia and European oil firms are poised to play a major role in refurbishing Iraq s oil_industry crippled by decades of war and sanctions
American companies walked away with stakes in just two of the 10 auctioned fields
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction which began Friday
The only one that submitted a bid lost
Two American companies reached deals for fields auctioned in June
The meager representation of American oil giants in Iraq s opening oil_industry surprised analysts
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of U.S. companies you have Asians and Europeans leading the way said Ruba Husari the editor of Iraq Oil Forum an online news outlet
It will be a long_time before anything else will be on offer in Iraq
Concerns over security underscored by massive coordinated bombings Tuesday and political instability as the U.S. military withdraws likely kept American oil_companies from venturing more forcefully in Iraq which has the world s thirdlargest proven crude reserves analysts said
U.S. firms were in some cases at a disadvantage because rivals particularly the Chinese and other government controlled energy firms have markedly lower labor costs and are more prone to take risks because they do nt respond to shareholders
ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached deals with the ministry
Major U.S. firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips which have cultivated close ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years walked away emptyhanded
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top stakeholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend
Stateowned China National Petroleum Corporation bid on more contracts than any other company and walked away with large stakes in contracts for two major fields
We all know that China is on track to become a major economic as well as technological power Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said
We feel confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments towards Iraq
Companies preselected to submit bids made offers that were then compared to the per barrel fee the ministry was willing to pay for boosting output above current levels at each field
US banks repay state support
The crisishit US major banks are breaking free from their state shackles
On Wednesday Bank of America repaid the support from the bank protection fund TARP in the amount USD 45 billion nearly EUR 30 billion in one go
And according to reports from US broadcaster CNBC Citigroup is also planning to repay the state support
The institutions thereby want to wiggle themselves free from the restrictions going handinhand with the acceptance of the money such as the limits on manager bonuses and the paying of high charges
Bank of America had raised some USD 19 billion from investors through convertible loans
The rest of the amount was taken from its own kitty which was well filled through the sale of business units
Bank head Kenneth Lewis extended his express thanks to the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening The cash injection helped over a very difficult time
The bank overstretched at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch
Citigroup also plans to raise cash on the capital market to free itself from its liabilities with the state
Already on Thursday the US bank was able to announce a capital increase of some USD 20 billion reported CNBC with reference to circles
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment
Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their support in June
Cheshire Appeal Will Point to Twitter
There were half_a_dozen of them typing away in the courtroom rows
Minute by minute they sent out reports of gruesome testimony via Twitter
In the end the defense says there were more than 140000 Twitter messages about the trial that dealt with rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set ablaze
On Thursday the widely followed trial of Steven J Hayes who was convicted of killing three members of a Cheshire Conn family is set to come to an official end with the judge s imposition of the death sentence voted for by the jury
But lawyers for Mr Hayes have already made court filings that sketch out appeals arguments that are likely to occupy the courts for years
One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial including mainstream reporters extensive use of Twitter created a circus atmosphere and such widespread instant saturation with inflammatory details that the jury was improperly swayed by public passions
The claim could force appeals judges to grapple with the question of whether new technology requires new courtroom rules
As I experienced it during this trial I think there s a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting an individual s fairtrial rights said Thomas J Ullmann Mr Hayes s chief defense_lawyer
The trial_judge Jon C Blue of State Superior_Court tersely rejected the claims in a ruling last week saying that the news_media were carefully controlled and that there was no evidence the jury was driven by passion
But that is not likely to be the last_word on the issue
For decades appeals_courts have recognized that coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about a trial s fairness
In a landmark 1966 ruling the United_States_Supreme_Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath Dr Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife saying in its decision Sheppard v Maxwell that there was a carnival atmosphere at trial because of the news_media
The crime is believed by some to have been the inspiration for the television_show and the movie The Fugitive
Some lawyers said appeals_courts reviewing Mr Hayes s conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules could be necessary to govern ways of communicating from courtrooms unimagined at the time of Dr Sheppard s case
There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media in highprofile trials said John J Donohue III a Stanford Law School professor who studied the Connecticut death_penalty and wrote a report that said it was arbitrarily enforced
Professor Donohue said some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms might make trials fairer
The Twitter issue is just one of many outlined by Mr Hayes s lawyers that are likely to be argued for years delaying an execution
The defense_lawyers also claim for example that Mr Hayes may have been prejudiced when Judge Blue declined to allow them to test potential jurors reactions by showing them grisly crimescene photographs during jury selection
Some of the jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims Jennifer HawkePetit 48 and her daughters Hayley 17 and Michaela 11
The defense_lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death_penalty and argue that the judge wrongly removed a juror who had been critical of prosecutors and that he improperly added pressure for a verdict by his unusual decision to direct the jury to deliberate over a weekend
The jurors were not sequestered
But their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the trial may draw the most interest
They noted in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United_States_Senate
They argued that the news_media continually fanned the flames of emotion about the case
The daily crush of media tweets cameras and reporters outside the courthouse the lawyers wrote was unlike anything ever seen here in New_Haven and maybe statewide
Their focus on the Twitter coverage is controversial
In interviews some journalists said the claim that instant news was more incendiary than reports delivered more slowly was a Luddite view that would make poor court policy governing coverage of future trials
But some lawyers said appeals_courts were often attracted to arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts
Mr Hayes s lawyers are pressing that claim
In their filing they referred to the Supreme_Court s 1966 decision overturning Dr Sheppard s conviction because of the trial coverage and made it clear they would claim that the new media required new rules
This case they wrote represents the Sheppard v Maxwell of the 21st century
Sport and fraud law
Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate wittiness but not the will to get remove of a sanction
The expulsion presumably forged by two players of Real Madrid Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos in the game played on the 23rd of November against Ajax in European Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about if such behavior is or is not unsportsmanlike and if both players should be sanctioned by UEFA
As we all know a few minutes before the end of the game that their team had already won both players deliberately wasted time which made the referee show the second yellow card to both of them
This way and since Real Madrid will finish as leader of its group both players will fulfil the prescribed sanction during the next game of league against Auxerre and will be able to get rid of the cards the following phase
Finally the committee of discipline of the UEFA has sanctioned with two games the trainer of the team Jose Mourinho and with different economic amounts the implied players
The provocation of a yellow card in similar circumstances as this one is not a new practice but rather frequent in the world of football
It is so extended that it part of the ethos of the unwritten rules but followed nonetheless by this sport
Part of the debate arisen in the related case is caused by the fact that has been carried out by team of the Real Madrid organization that in its hymn presumes of nobility and honor and that has fined its players for analogous acts and by the dramatization orchestrated apparently by Mourinho who adds one more to his expanded history of histrionic and provoking technician
Anyway the debate deals with if that type of behavior not prohibited specifically by the regulation contradicts the principles of the sport that is to say if with these actions fraud is committed then indeed they are respectful actions with the sport regulation but they seem to elude its sense
The matter examines the type of damage that is brought to the sporting spirit
One of the advantages that include the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players aspect that with these actions was nt put into danger that is to say there was no violent game
Another of these advantages to which it is alluded to with the fareplay is to avoid that the team of the lawbreaker players takes advantage unjustly of the opposite team which did not happen either
However the paradoxical thing about the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not comply to what we normally characterize as legal_fraud because the violation of the rules was not made secretly as to try to avoid the sanction but their action was most evident and thus they received punishment from the referee
They waited for and accepted the sanction with no complaints
Another question is what type of advantage the violators obtained in the actions deliberately carried out
Here it seems necessary to state that it is nt a disadvantageous situation for rival nor is an obtained benefit in the same game because evidently the result of the action supposes leaving their own team with less players
And neither is it a useful strategy for the next game because the club will not be able to count on those players
The advantage obviously consists in the fact that the players will begin the following phase of the Championship without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game
But it is about a long term advantage with a certain degree of indetermination because the team can be eliminated first of change and in addition with this action the players fulfil a sanction game and go to the second cycle of cards in which the suspension by card accumulation takes place with one less than in the first cycle
So that by passing rounds it is not so clear that it is an advantage
Those actions are really against the sporting spirit which is part of the strategic decisions that favor taking advantages allowed by the rules
Regarding this assumption the players did not act in order to avoid the application of the sanction this would have been a clear case of legal_fraud but rather chosen when to obey it
They made a strategic decision without avoiding the punishment
Although the border between the wittiness and the law fraud is diffuse in this occasion I believe it was a clear case of wittiness
The controversy seems to arise from two factors because it was about two auto expulsions and the way the transmission of the directive was carried out to cause them
The damage brought about to the principles of the sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic
Arsenictolerant microbe raises possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients widens the scope for finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond
While researchers discovered the unusual bacteria here in Earth they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential
This organism has dual capability
It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic
That makes it very peculiar though it falls short of being some form of truly alien life commented Paul C W Davies of Arizona State University a coauthor of the report appearing in Thursday s online edition of the journal Science
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and sulfur
But the researchers found that the bacteria discovered in Mono Lake Calif. is able to continue to grow after substituting arsenic for phosphorus
It makes you wonder what else is possible said Ariel D Anbar of Arizona State University a coauthor of the report
The find is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life to know what life looks like Anbar said
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth
However the announcement of a news_conference to discuss it which did not disclose details of the find generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report would disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life
It did nt
The discovery does show that in other planetary environments organisms might be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the standard set of elements we think are absolutely necessary for life might not be so fixed commented Charles Cockell professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute Open_University in Milton Keynes United_Kingdom
Cockell was not part of the research team
This work is novel because it shows the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure added Cockell
It was nt a chance discovery
Felisa WolfeSimon of NASA s Astrobiology Institute who led the study targeted Mono Lake because it has high arsenic levels
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar so she speculated that a microbe exposed to both might be able to substitute one for the other
Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is so similar to that of phosphorus
As a result organisms have a hard_time telling these elements apart
But arsenic is different enough that it does nt work as well as phosphorus so it gets in there and sort of gums up the works of our biochemical machinery explained Anbar
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic which it was able to adapt to and grow
The microbe does grow better on phosphorus but showing that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life_form using arsenic could occur naturally either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common
Jamie S Foster an assistant_professor of microbiology at the University of Florida said the idea that arsenic could be substituted for phosphorus is nt new but there has never been example where it was shown to work
Arsenic was more common in the early times on Earth she said so researchers have speculated that early life_forms might have used it
It does suggest that that there could be other ways to form life not just how life formed on early Earth said Foster who was not part of WolfeSimon s research team
The research was supported by NASA the Department_of_Energy and the National_Institutes_of_Health
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin_America continues to edge up as does backing for private_enterprise
Crime has become a bigger worry than unemployment
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United_States across much of the region
Those are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist
Because the poll has been taken regularly since 1995 it tracks changes in attitude across the region
Two related things stand out in the results of this year s poll taken in September and early October
The first is Latin_America s fairly sunny mood
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its core institutions
Support for democracy has risen noticeably in several countries on the Pacific rim of South_America see table 1
For example in Peru where economic_growth has averaged 6 a year since 2002 support for democracy has risen from a low of 40 in 2005 to 61 this year
It also rose in Mexico where the economy has recovered after suffering a big drop in output last year
But only around half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil the region s two most populous countries are convinced democrats which drags down the regional average see chart 2
Some 44 of respondents across the region pronounced themselves satisfied with how their country s democracy works in practice the same figure as last year but a big increase on the 25 in 2001 chart 3
Some 34 said they had confidence in their country s Congress and 45 in their government the same as last year in both cases but up sharply from 2003 17 and 24 respectively
A decade ago economic woes in Latin_America undermined support for democracy
That it has held up during the world financial crisis is probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery
In addition a stronger social safety_net has helped to shield the poor
The United_Nations Economic_Commission_for_Latin_America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only marginally in 2009 and has fallen again this year to 32 RRB
But the mood varies widely from country to country see chart 4
Brazil s strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widely shared sense of progress
That is scarcer in Mexico and Central_America where the recession was more severe and violent crime has worsened
For only the second time since the polls began more respondents across Latin_America as a whole cite crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem facing their country see chart 5
Some 31 say that either they or a close relative have been victims of crime over the past year but that is down from 38 last year and is the lowest figure since 1995
A more robust economic performance is reflected in rising support for private_enterprise and the market_economy some 71 of respondents across the region say that private_enterprise is indispensable for development up from 56 in 2007 see chart 6
Some 58 agree that the market_economy is the only system that will make their country developed up from 47 last year
Interestingly 62 of respondents in Venezuela hold that view and 80 there back private_enterprise even though their leftwing president Hugo Chávez is expropriating many private companies
Brazil is the country which exercises most leadership in the region mentioned by 19 of respondents up from 18 last year followed by the United_States 9 unchanged from last year and Venezuela 9 down from 11 last year
But the United_States is seen as the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central_America whereas Venezuela enjoys that distinction in Ecuador the Dominican_Republic and Nicaragua
Scalia and Thomas dine with healthcare law challengers as court takes case
The day the Supreme_Court gathered behind closed doors to consider the politically divisive question of whether it would hear a challenge to President Obama s healthcare law two of its justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas were feted at a dinner sponsored by the law_firm that will argue the case before the high_court
The occasion was last Thursday when all nine justices met for a conference to pour over the petitions for review
One of the cases at issue was a suit brought by 26 states challenging the sweeping healthcare overhaul passed by Congress last year a law that has been a rallying_cry for conservative activists nationwide
The justices agreed to hear the suit indeed a landmark 55 hour argument is expected in March and the outcome is likely to further roil the 2012 presidential race which will be in full swing by the time the court s decision is released
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the law should be thrown out is likely to be Paul Clement who served as US solicitor general during the George W Bush administration
Clement s law_firm Bancroft PLLC was one of almost two_dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society a longstanding group dedicated to advocating conservative legal_principles
Another firm that sponsored the dinner Jones Day represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law the National Federation of Independent Business
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc which has an enormous financial stake in the outcome of the litigation
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court s conference over the case
In attendance was among others Mitch McConnell the Senate s top Republican and an avowed opponent of the healthcare law
The featured guests at the dinner Scalia and Thomas
It s nothing new The two justices have been attending Federalist Society events for years
And it s nothing that runs afoul of ethics rules
In fact justices are exempt from the Code_of_Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal justices
If they were they arguably fell under code s Canon 4C which states A judge may attend fundraising events of lawrelated and other organizations although the judge may not be a speaker a guest_of_honor or featured on the program of such an event
Nevertheless the sheer proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law_firms in the case as well as to a company with a massive financial interest was enough to alarm ethicsingovernment activists
This stunning breach of ethics and indifference to the code belies claims by several justices that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges said Bob Edgar the president of Common Cause
The justices were wining and dining at a blacktie fundraiser with attorneys who have pending cases before the court
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality and is unacceptable
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics who say they too readily mix the business of the court with agendadriven groups such as the Federalist Society
And Thomas wife Ginni is a highprofile conservative activist
Moreover conservatives argue that it s Justice Elena Kagan who has an ethical issue not Scalia and Thomas
Kagan served as solicitor_general in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were brought at the trial_court level
Her critics have pushed for Kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case saying that she was too invested in defending the law then to be impartial now
Kagan has given no indication she will do so
The familiarity of the Spanish is higher than that of the Ticos
Of the 22 players called in Spain ten passed 50 international games
On the side of Costa_Rica only one of 22 called players reached 50 games
A minor contrast to Costa_Rica comparing the 22 players called by both countries for the friendly game today at 305 pm at the National Stadium in San_Jose
While the Europe and world champions number_one one in the monthly top of FIFA have a long record of Class A inter selection the Tricolor has only the defender Michael Umana as the only one who has 50 international games
That number was reached Friday before the game against Panama 02 in Rommel Fernandez
Spanish football_players playing in the AllStar League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England are during the year very active in league and local cup competitions and there are highlevel shocks in the European Cups and European Champions League
To this is added the Spanish Fury experience in complicated qualifications for Euro Cup and World_Cup
The Ticos players however have a limited international experience in an area such as CONCACAF which is considered the lowest level within FIFA
We see that the peak of the Spanish selection is the goalkeeper Iker Casillas who last Saturday against England game lost with 01 in London equaled the record of the ex goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and will impose a new record of 127 international matches for Spain
Xavi Hernandez the player of Barcelona has 106 matches
Casillas and Xavi were recognized last week by UEFA together with the other player of the Iberian team Zubizarreta with 126 matches and Schalke striker Raul Gonzalez with 102
Almost near the centennial number is Carles Puyol with 97 games
Xabi Alonso follows them with 91 Fernando Torres with 90 David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81 Andres Iniesta with 62 Cesc Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53
On Costa Rican side and close to Michael Umana are the leftlateral Junior Diaz with 48 matches and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45
After this only five exceeded the 30 games Keilor Navas with 31 Randall Azofeifa with 32 Michael Barrantes with 31 Carlos Hernandez with 36 and Jose Luis Lopez with 35
The least
More than 30 matches in Spain have Gerard Piqué 37 Sergio Busquets 36 Santiago Santi Cazorla 32 Alvaro Arbeloa 31 and Raul Albiol 31
On the national side with less than 30 presences there are Roy Miller with 26 Winston Parks with 26 Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23
The rest does nt come near the 20
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two in Costa_Rica Victor Bolivar has only one Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder did not debut yet
The leading scorer of Spain is David Villa is with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres with 27
For Costa Rica Bryan Ruiz is the one that registers more points two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy
Immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from various aspects a congestion of police legal and administrative services subjected to a policy of numbers and the compatibility of that policy with the selfproclaimed status of the country as the country of French human_rights
More recently it is administrative harassment of foreign students which is topical with the minister of the interior Libération on 23 May declaring that France does not need foreign talent bricklayers and waiters
But it is only rarely analyzed from the economic viewpoint
There is a lot of consensus between the Left and the Right on this subject
On the Right the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that 900000 unemployed would not become a problem in a country with 2 million of foreign workers and on the Left by Michel Rocard explaining in 1990 that France can not accommodate all the world s misery
The only difference the degree of generosity
In 2005 the fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was felt both on the Left and on the Right
Both sides see immigrants as a burden on the French economy and on French society
The only difference resides in the degree of generosity which one deigns to grant to immigrants
In his program François Hollande confines himself to banalities saying that codevelopment would allow our immigration problem to be solved
This notion of immigration being a burden and a problem may be an electoral asset but it is economically very costly
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book summarising the most recent knowledge of immigration Exceptional People How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future mai 2011 Princeton University Press 352 pp there is wide consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic_growth wages and employment in countries which admit immigrants
Restraining immigration leads to anaemic growth and harms employment
Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the notion that they are liable to replace native workers in particular unskilled ones exerting downward pressure on wages
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more complementary to rather than replacements of local labor exercising trades in which there is a shortage of local labor
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors which do not attract local labor and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment
A positive effect on wages
In the same way as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists the complementarities existing between locals and immigrants bring it about that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the pay of locals
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a rise of 1 in the migratory flow causes an increase of between 06 and 09 in real longterm pay
And does so without taking into account the fact that the diversity contributed by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic_growth a large proportion of naturalised immigrants are among American Nobel_prize winners whilst Google Intel Paypal eBay and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants
Migrants are also net contributors to social_systems averaging 1 of the total budgets of European_countries
The World Labor Organisation estimates that for example in Germany an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution receipts less expenditure of an average of 150000 Euros to public budgets during his lifetime
Nicolas Sarkozy wished at the start of his mandate to look for missing points of growth with the teeth
The teeth in question intended to serve to dissuade immigrants had precisely the opposite effect
