Thats what the man had said
Haney peered doubtfully at his drinking companion through bleary tear_filled eyes
He had no ready answer as much from surprise as from the fit of coughing
Was the man drunk or crazy or both
But his new_found buddy had matched him drink for drink until he lost count and the man s eyes were still clear
The guy is off his rocker Haney thought to himself and looked_away from those eyes
Eyes that were clear but also bright with a strange intensity a sort of cold fire burning behind them
Why had nt he noticed it before
No the man was not drunk
He wondered how he got tied up with this stranger
But of course he remembered now
It was blurred after two hours of steady drinking but the occasion of it came_back to him
The stranger his head seemingly sunk in thought started to cross the street against the light just as a huge moving_van roared through the intersection
Brakes howled and a horn blared furiously but the man would have been hit if Phil had nt called_out to him a second before
His shout had been involuntary something anybody might have done without thinking on_the_spur_of_the_moment
As_a_matter_of_fact he would nt have cared at all if the guy had been hit
Actually he regretted having opened his mouth when the truck came_to a stop and the angry driver jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them
By then the stranger was thanking Haney profusely and had one arm around his shoulders as if he were an old friend
So the driver started to curse at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his safe_driving record
Then the man he saved turned and looked squarely into the truck_driver s face without saying a word
Very suddenly the driver stopped swearing at them turned on his heel and went back to his truck
Haney had nt given it much thought at the time
Now he recalled it very clearly and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off
It must have been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word
When the light went their way they went_on across the street
And when the stranger found_out that Phil was on_the_way to one of his favorite bars he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them
Phil usually went alone and kept_to_himself sitting in a corner and passing the time by nursing his favorite grudges
But he decided he would nt mind company in_return for free drinks even though he made good money at his job
Phil was like that
Now he wondered if it was worth it having a screwball for company
He really did nt take the offer seriously but he began to feel uneasy
When he finally got the coughing under control he realized that Pete _LRB_ all he gave was his first_name _RRB_ was still waiting for an answer __ he did nt even seem to wink as he continued to stare
Haney managed a weak laugh
Guess I ca nt think of anyone Pete
Thanks anyhow
A faint crease appeared between the man s eyebrows
I think you are nt taking me seriously Phil
I meant it
And everybody has some kind of grudge
I might have got hit by that truck if it was nt for you
I believe in returning favors
I ll do anything for somebody I like
It wo nt cost you a cent Phil
Go_ahead and try me
Phil rubbed his forehead wearily
He was beginning to feel woolly
Maybe it would be better to humor the guy and then make an exit
He really did nt expect anything to come of it and there were a few people
All right he conceded finally if you must know I do nt get_along_with the landlord
He keeps riding me because I like to listen to the radio and sing while I m taking a bath
He says the neighbors complain but I do nt believe it
Why do nt they tell me themselves if it bothers them
The man closed his eyes and nodded
When he looked up again he seemed almost contented
Fine
Give me your address
It will take a little time
I want to study your landlord s habits and movements first
You see I always make it look like an accident
Maybe suicide if it looks reasonable
In that way theres no trouble for the customer
Haney s eyebrows flew up
Customer
Pete smiled modestly
Its my line_of_work he said
Five minutes later before Haney could make his break the stranger stood_up and nodded farewell
Haney watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure
Phil decided to stay a little longer and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there but for the other glass on the table
Some time before midnight he returned to his apartment and hit_the_sack putting the whole incident out of mind before he fell_asleep
The next day Sunday the hangover reminded Haney where he had been the night before
The hangover in turn reminded him of his conversation with the weirdy and he groaned
He went for more aspirin later in the day and passed the surly landlord on_the_way __ he was still alive and scowling as_usual as if tenants were a burden in his life
Phil shrugged and ignored him
He went back to work Monday
By Wednesday the landlord was still alive
Of_course On Thursday Haney mailed the monthly check for separate maintenance to his wife Lolly and wished the stranger could do something about her
Coming home from work he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment building
Inside the lobby people were standing around talking excitedly
His spine crawled with a foreboding premonition as he asked one of his fellow tenants what had happened
The landlord had died
Late that afternoon it seemed he had fallen off the roof while on some obscure errand or inspection
He had apparently been alone
Nobody witnessed the fall __ just the sickening impact when his body smashed on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance
Haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks
He muttered something about how terrible it was and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator
Once inside his apartment he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped limply in a chair
After a while he began to feel better about it especially when no one bothered to ask any questions
But after all why should they
Still later he finally convinced himself that it was an accident __ just a coincidence
The stranger really had nothing to do with it of course
Haney went_to_bed happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord
After all the man had no family so no one suffered and everybody was better off for it
Really he said to himself nobody kills a man just as a favor
So you thought I did nt mean what I said
The stranger s eyes were large and sad as if Phil Haney had hurt his feelings
It was like a recurrent annoying dream but now the dream was beginning to take on overtones of a nightmare
However Haney knew it was not a dream
He might be very tight but he knew where he was
It was the same bar and it was two weeks later __ Saturday night when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual
He had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table as_far_as_possible from any talkative friendly lushes
He was enjoying the weekly ritual of washing_down his pet grievance with bourbon slightly moistened with water
This favorite grievance was not the landlord
He had already quite forgotten about him
In fact he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment
His real grievance was Lolly
Toward the end of his fourth hairy highball while he was moodily making wet rings on the table_top with the bottom of the glass he became aware that he was not alone
He looked up with bloodshot eyes and beheld the stranger sitting across the table smiling a secret smile at him as if they were fellow conspirators
He had nt even noticed __ what was his name Pete __ he had nt seen him sit_down
The man was uncanny like a shadow and made as much noise as a shadow
Haney felt_like shrinking out_of_sight but he was already trapped in the corner with the wiry dark little man
He began to wish that he had nt shouted that other evening when the truck bore_down through the crossing
Was he going to be saddled from now on with a creep for a bar_buddy
He d have to start going to some of the other places again
In a low voice almost whispering the man had asked Phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken_off his back
He made the mistake of answering in an offhand way and instantly realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice
Pete frowned slightly then became sad and moody
Haney did nt want to encourage his company but felt he ought to buy him a drink anyhow to prevent possible trouble
But there was no trouble
The guy sulked over his drink obviously upset by Haney s lack of appreciation
To break the uncomfortable silence Haney began to talk
In time and two drinks later he was complaining bitterly about his wife He was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he noticed the renewed interest in his listener __ it showed in the alert face and the suddenly bright eyes
When he paused to moisten his throat the stranger broke_in
But why pay her bills
If she runs_around with other men and if you hate her as you say why not just divorce her
Haney scowled
That bitch would love a divorce he growled
Then she d get half of everything I have
Community_property deal __ you know
I d have to sell_out my business to pay her off with her share
She can drop dead
Pete nodded understandingly
Oh yes
Now I see
You must understand I have nt been in this state too long
I came out here to retire
Thats why I __ why I do a free job now and then
You should have told me about her before
Haney felt a twinge of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again
Then a wild thought ran circles through his clouded brain
Suppose __ just suppose this guy was really what he said he was T
A retired professional killer
If he was just a nut no harm was done
But if he was the real_thing he could do something about Lolly
He felt very cunning very proud of himself as he played on the other man s soft_spot
No offense intended he said gently
But its just that __ well you know
The cops did nt suspect a thing and I thought it was a coincidence
After all I did nt know you Pete
It could have been an accident
He shrugged casually
But if you say you managed it
The stranger was hooked
His eyes burned feverishly
Yes yes he muttered impatiently
Of_course it looked like an accident
I always work it that way __ and always at a time when the customer has an alibi
Let me prove it Phil
I think I can manage one more favor for you
He waited eagerly
Haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass
Tuesday s rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that has nt backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that at least at the federal level political ticket splitting has been on the rise over the past half_century
In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20 % of the nation s congressional districts choose a different party s candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives
Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40 %
As we know voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress
In every presidential election over the past half_century except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress
Prior to 1932 the pattern was nearly the opposite
What accounts for the results of recent decades
A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split_personality displayed by Americans in the voting_booth
The theory relies on three assumptions
1 _RRB_ Voters can buy one of two brands when they select their political agents __ a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest
2 _RRB_ Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office __ dealing with national issues _LRB_ programmatic actions such as casting roll_call votes on legislation that imposes costs andor confers benefits on the population at large _RRB_ and attending to local issues _LRB_ constituency service and pork_barrel _RRB_
3 _RRB_ Republican congressional representatives because of their belief in a minimalist state are less willing to engage in local benefit_seeking than are Democratic members of Congress
If these assumptions hold voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner s dilemma and have an incentive at the margin to lean Democratic
If they put a Republican into office not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from bringing home the bacon to their respective constituencies
Each legislator after all is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making
In races for the White House a voter s incentive at the margin is to lean Republican
Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter s particular district/state such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing_home the local benefits
The individual voter s standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes
While this theory is exceedingly simple it appears to explain several things
First why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half_century Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner s dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe
Second it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives Any individual legislator s constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency
Third the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit_seeking have lower security in office
For_example first_term members of the House once the most vulnerable of incumbents have become virtually immune to defeat
The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re_election in 1982
Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role __ spreading the Reagan revolution __ in national policy making they were more vulnerable to defeat
Fourth the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office
Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent
To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner s dilemma game works to their disadvantage the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates
Fifth the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South
To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office
Finally the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House
Since local benefit_seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit_seeking than their Democratic counterparts
Is there any empirical support for this theory
Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit_seeking than their Republican colleagues
First economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn_back roughly 10 more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do
To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit_seeking this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns
Second if the key assumption is valid Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll_call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit_seeking
This is indeed what the data indicate particularly in the case of the House
The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959
Finally as shown in the table Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices __ where local benefit_seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices
An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 _LRB_ when control of that body changed party hands _RRB_ moreover reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise due to their majority_party status over other resources such as committee staff
An additional piece of evidence from the Senate Holding other factors constant such as incumbency advantages and regional factors the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns_out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal_government s tax burden is per state _LRB_ a progressive tax_rate hits higher income states harder _RRB_
Put more simply GOP candidates for president are looked_on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner s dilemma is more severe
Moreover ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level
State government is more typically split along Republican_governor Democratic_legislature lines than the reverse
A cross_state econometric investigation furthermore reveals that holding other factors constant the difference between a state s major party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax_rate
In sum at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting_booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation

In the long frightening night after Tuesday s devastating earthquake Bay Area residents searched for comfort and solace wherever they could
Some found it on the screen of a personal_computer
Hundreds of Californians made their way to their computers after the quake and checked in with each other on electronic bulletin_boards which link computers CB_radio_style via phone_lines
Some of the most vivid bulletins came over The Well a Sausalito Calif board that is one of the liveliest outposts of the electronic underground
About two_thirds of the Well s 3000 subscribers live in the Bay Area
The quake knocked The Well out for six hours but when it came back up it teemed with emotional first_hand reports

I actually thought that I might die
I could nt decide if I should come home to Marin because my house is on stilts
I decided to brave the storm
There was a horrible smell of gas as I passed the Chevron refinery before crossing the Richmond_San Rafael Bridge
I could also see the clouds across the bay from the horrible fire in the Marina District of San Francisco
I have felt many aftershocks
My back is still in knots and my hands are still shaking
I think a few of the aftershocks might just be my body shaking

Downtown Bolinas seems to be the part of town thats worst off
No power minimal phones and a mess of mayonnaise wine and everything else all over the floors of the big old general_store and the People s Co_op
The quivers move through my house every few minutes at unpredictable intervals and the mouse thats been living in my kitchen has taken refuge under my desk
It runs_out frantically now and then and is clearly pretty distressed
I was in Stinson Beach when the quake rolled through town
At first we were unfazed
Then as things got rougher we ran for the door and spent the next few minutes outside watching the brick sidewalk under our feet oozing up and down and the flowers waving in an eerie rhythm
Amazing what it does to one s heart_rate and one s short_term memory
Everyone looked calm but there was this surreal low level of confusion as the aftershocks continued

I got home let the dogs into the house and noticed some sounds above my head as if someone were walking on the roof or upstairs
Then I noticed the car was bouncing up and down as if someone were jumping on it
I realized what was happening and screamed into the house for the dogs
Cupboard doors were flying the trash_can in the kitchen walked a few feet the dogs came running and I scooted them into the dog run and stood in the doorway myself watching the outside trash cans dance across the concrete
When I realized it was over I went and stood out in_front of the house waiting and praying for Merrill to come home shivering as if it were 20 below zero until he got there
Never in my life have I been so frightened
When I saw the pictures of 880 and the Bay Bridge I began to cry

We are all fine here although Mame was extremely freaked
Kitchen full of broken crystal
Books and tapes all over my room
